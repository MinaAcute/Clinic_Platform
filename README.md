## Project Structure

The codebase is organized into folders for better management:

- `/config`: Configuration files.
- `/controllers`: Controllers for handling routes.
- `/middlewares`: Custom middleware functions.
- `/models`: MongoDB schema models.
- `/routes`: API routes.

## Security and Access

### User Authentication

User authentication is implemented using Passport.js. There are two types of users: doctors and patients. Authentication and authorization are enforced based on user roles.

### Data Encryption

Data transmission between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS to ensure data security.

## Database Design

### MongoDB Schema

- **User**: Stores user information (e.g., username, email, hashed password).
- **PatientProfile**: Stores patient profiles (e.g., first name, last name, medical history) and references the doctor.

### Connections

A relationship is established between doctors and patients by linking patient profiles to their respective doctors.

## API Creation

### API Endpoints

The API provides endpoints for the following functionalities:

- User registration and login.
- Viewing and updating patient profiles.
- Sending email notifications to patients upon profile updates.

### Request Validation

All incoming API requests are validated to ensure data integrity and security. Validation errors are handled appropriately.

## Notifications

### Email Notifications

Email notifications are sent to patients when their profiles are updated. Nodemailer is used to securely send emails.

## Documentation

### Swagger Documentation

API details and authentication methods are documented using Swagger. The API documentation is accessible at `/api-docs` endpoint.

## Code Quality

### Coding Standards

The codebase follows consistent coding standards to enhance code readability and maintainability.

### Error Handling

Errors are handled effectively using try-catch blocks to ensure smooth application operation and a better user experience.

## Scalability

Design the system to handle more users and data.
